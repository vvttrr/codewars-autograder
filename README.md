# codewars-autograder
I use this tool to check if students have completed certain assignments that I have assigned on https://www.codewars.com


- written in Python & Py Notebook
- INPUTS:
  - a csv file of your student's names and their codewars usernames
  - a csv file containing every question you assigned, their codewars KEY ID, and how many points the question is worth.
- OUTPUT:
  - pandas dataframe with each student's name, what questions they got right, and their score
